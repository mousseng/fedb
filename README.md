Fire Emblem data, in shiny new SQL form

## work in progress
the tables aren't even all set up, and there's a lot of data entry to do.

## who is this even for?
me, mostly. i think it's easier to write a quick sql query than use a lot of the currently-available tools.
and also better for exploration/discovery.

but anyone can use it for whatever the hell they want.
